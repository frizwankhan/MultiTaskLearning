torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 192.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 31.74 GiB of which 57.38 MiB is free. Process 2991625 has 436.00 MiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 31.25 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 30.06 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 640.78 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
